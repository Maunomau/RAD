Do I want diagonal movement? MD games have that but that's no reason on it's own to have it. I do like walls blocking diagonal attacks while open areas allow them, it makes positioning more important.

Combat encounters instead of just bump attacks and such? Not for the 7DRL version, what I do want though is somehow ending up with results that combat encounters would give.
  Monster next to you.
    Move away.
      You escape, monster stays where it was.(unlikely without using a charge?)
      You're chased, monster follows.
      You get obstructed/tripped, you fail to move. Lose energy?(Moving somewhere you didn't intend to could be a thing but might be annoying)
        You fail to move again, you get caught/swallowed.
    Attack monster
      You lose energy and monster is
        stunned and loses energy
        stunned
        loses energy
        unharmed
    Pass a turn
      Monster blocked your escape this turn.
      Monster attacks, you lose energy
      Monster knocks you down, you're stunned
    Use charge, next action more successful but charge/rune needs to be recollected after it reappears nearby in a few turns.

Not sure how random I want what happens to be, I could have it be mostly deterministic and base things on charge use, monster type, energy levels, familiarity and deals with only randomness from what the enemy tries to do. Or I could have what happens have a random element with charges, monster type ect. mainly affecting likelihoods of what happens. Random would be easier in some ways though would need various options to deal with things when they go badly.

Rabbits are deadly, sure they won't try to attack you but being within 2 tiles of one still risks taking damage from them randomly deciding to go to your tile.
  I could make them just not attack ever, they'd still be somewhat interesting as they might block you.




plans, ideas and hopeful todo:
Idea: put 0 to 3 flesh eggs into water each level, stepping on water has a chance of disturbing an egg, quakes (on turns 50+ or so?) also do that and also expand water tiles.
  Also water required for healing or something?
  Nighttime start event?
  
UI
  TU bar
  Runes section
  Spells
  Soundmap
  Clickable controls
  Allies
  Daytime/Season

Shrinking
  Enter crawlable areas without crouching
  New even smaller entrances(tiny pathways)
    Contents not necessarily displayed, could effectively be portals
      Considering also just crawl sized one, idea being that it'd be easy to replace walls next to existing vent entrances with them so vents aren't just weird doors and I don't necessarily need to generate vent sections as part of same map.
        Actually generating a separate vent map could be an option though. Might be boring to move in if it just links the vent entrances together so either make auto run in corridors thing or make the vent map more interesting.
  Some explanation for how you achieve shrinking(power of belt or something)
Building "a rail way" that you can use to "teleport" along it (when shrunk).
  Potentially just have preexisting lines that indicate tiny pathways and such.
Level edge exits
  For base building(esp. a home base of sorts), if you've got just up or down as directions to go there's limited reasons for building stuff(prep for ascension would be good one though).
  Start off in a (seemingly?) dead end and need to go few levels in one direction before reaching ideal central base location where there are multiple exits
    if defensibility is a concern the base spot could be just before the crossing.
Day-night cycle.
  No light at night, so at least limited LoS, could go all the way and make you effectively blind and move based on memory and sounds.

todo:
make fast monsters animate nicely(the 1st move is instant atm.)
  WOOP works fine so somehow getting it to do the two tile move in one step would work
limited free turning? Should try having it so you can look in only 2 or 3 directions, otherwise once I add facing based FoV you'd want to spin around every turn, or maybe just have one direction(behind) you can't see and no free turning. Or I could just not have turning affect FoV.
  Maybe have a bar or such with 3 or 4 free actions and have picking up stuff take 1, getting up take 2, start crawling 1 or 2. Should actually doing full turn actions take 1 so that turn ends once you get to 4?
Magic circles that allow casting (any or specific?) spells for free?
  Or some other way to make playing frugally/optimally more interesting, as is you do interesting stuff only when it's the only way to avoid taking damage.
Wake up sounds(wasps esp.)
Runedrop indicator? Show rune icons on UI, fancy way would be to show runes moving from count to drop indicator and then to level.
Oh, runes could be just the icon to avoid needing to call them runes.
Sound panning, stereo sound based on if sound source is to left or right
Soundmap.
Soundmap focus, passing a turn should show sounds on the main map instead of less accurate sound map.

communicate runes causing new spawns better if I don't change how spawns work(I will)
time until next spawn counter
line to new spawn?
Remove/Change spawning, while the game is kind of fun with it I want a different feel.

Line of Sight

Slime puddles
Spider webs
Mirrors(make crystals actually immobile but able to spawn mirrors that they shoot at to attack you)
Different floor after destroyed wall
would crystal being able to swap with you using woop be too much?
running
max spells and spell swapping
make enmies spawn better(based on room type and world time)
adjust spells to work in a way where each spell has a dedicated slot.
warp to main and lose all runes if outside at the end of day?
make score count total charge of all circles
  (is there anything besides time that could differentiate score of one winning run from another? Deals/Contracts if I get around to adding them. Some other collectable(gems once I've changed runes to not be gems). Monster interactions... Actually damage taken might be an easy one though that being 0 shouldn't be too hard so would need something else too.)
line building after finding all outer circles?
"cantrip" spells that don't cost runes(but maybe energy)
  perhaps get these based from monsters in some way.
  or have them be crouched versions of normal spells
    push, 
      push back 1 enemy by 1 tile
    spawn mirror,
      (in front of you, possibly 2 or 3 tiles away though if it's say a corridor it could go straight until there's actually something to either side of it)
    web, 
      create web that stuns enemies for 1 turn
    jump/blink/glide, 
      move 2 or 3 (flyable) tiles straight instantly
    slimeslide, (slimepuddle)
      dash but crawling and no attack and leave behind a line of slime puddles or just spawn slime puddle(s) nearby.
  
Something edible that gives energy/hp. Shrooms?
Decide what to do with pits,
  are they just walls that allow flying creatures/things to pass and don't block vision or is there a way to fall into them and what happens if you do? Fall(or just warp) back into the room at random spot and take damage would be easy, could also do lower levels but that reminds me that I might want the world gen to not require entirely blank rooms to prevent exits in that direction since making lower areas match pits at higher level... I could just check for a room below before spawning pits couldn't I?
Golem monster that uses current crystal behaviour aside from wooping
fix haste breaking on map change
indicate future rune drop spots?
resting hpup time counter


done:
circle warps
make usedRunes level based
Haste spell
outer circle locations and discovery
Banish/Seal spell
no stun on attack?
need some way to track collected gems on a worldmap level.
Doing damage to resting enemies can break their hp display or something.
daynight
going back to previous areas
Level edge exits
mapgen RNG separate from normal RNG
seeded mapgen
getConnectedTiles doesn't work correctly?(inBounds checks fixed it)
Fix turning sometimes failing to show your sprite.(Issue was type coercion sometimes detecting that for a reason no longer relevant I had set player.dir to be a string of a number)
water
pits are water
submergion
crawling
knockout instead of delete enemies
pass turn
Indicate growled state somehow.
sound volume based on distance
fix last exit not working
fix island detection
facing
somehow ensure closest sounds take priority or do something else with situation of multiple things playing the same sound(stagger them?)

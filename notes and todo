Do I want diagonal movement? MD games have that but that's no reason on it's own to have it. I do like walls blocking diagonal attacks while open areas allow them, it makes positioning more important.

Combat encounters instead of just bump attacks and such? Not for the 7DRL version, what I do want though is somehow ending up with results that combat encounters would give.
  Monster next to you.
    Move away.
      You escape, monster stays where it was.(unlikely without using a charge?)
      You're chased, monster follows.
      You get obstructed/tripped, you fail to move. Lose energy?(Moving somewhere you didn't intend to could be a thing but might be annoying)
        You fail to move again, you get caught/swallowed.
    Attack monster
      You lose energy and monster is
        stunned and loses energy
        stunned
        loses energy
        unharmed
    Pass a turn
      Monster blocked your escape this turn.
      Monster attacks, you lose energy
      Monster knocks you down, you're stunned
    Use charge, next action more successful but charge/rune needs to be recollected after it reappears nearby in a few turns.

Not sure how random I want what happens to be, I could have it be mostly deterministic and base things on charge use, monster type, energy levels, familiarity and deals with only randomness from what the enemy tries to do. Or I could have what happens have a random element with charges, monster type ect. mainly affecting likelihoods of what happens. Random would be easier in some ways though would need various options to deal with things when they go badly.

Rabbits are deadly, sure they won't try to attack you but being within 2 tiles of one still risks taking damage from them randomly deciding to go to your tile.
  I could make them just not attack ever, they'd still be somewhat interesting as they might block you.


Idea: Pits are water, put 0 to 3 flesh eggs into water each level, stepping on water has a chance of disturbing an egg, quakes (on turns 50+ or so?) also do that and also expand water tiles.
  Also water required for healing or something?


todo:
water
submergion
seeded mapgen
going back to previous areas
  make usedCharges level based
make fast monsters animate nicely(the 1st move is instant atm.)
  WOOP works fine so somehow getting it to do the two tile move in one step would work
communicate runes causing new spawns better if I don't change how spawns work
  time until next spawn counter
  line to new spawn?
stereo sound based on if sound source is to left or right
adjust spells to work in a way where each spell has a dedicated slot.
crawling
mapgen RNG separate from normal RNG
limited free turning? Should try having it so you can look in only 2 or 3 directions, otherwise once I add facing based FoV you'd want to spin around every turn, or maybe just have one direction(behind) you can't see and no free turning. Or I could just not have turning affect FoV.
  Maybe have a bar or such with 3 or 4 free actions and have picking up stuff take 1, getting up take 2, start crawling 1 or 2. Should actually doing full turn actions take 1 so that turn ends once you get to 4?
Magic circles that allow casting (any or specific?) spells for free?
  Or some other way to make playing frugally/optimally more interesting, as is you do interesting stuff only when it's the only way to avoid taking damage.

  

done:
knockout instead of delete enemies
pass turn
Indicate growled state somehow.
sound volume based on distance
fix last exit not working
fix island detection
facing
somehow ensure closest sounds take priority or do something else with situation of multiple things playing the same sound(stagger them?)
